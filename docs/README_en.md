### Ariel

Program for acquiring and processing eddy current signals from PL500 device
![](./img/ariel.png)

Program allows you to connect to Rohman PL500 eddy current testing device and store eddy current testing data to files. Scecond application allows to view and analyse signals acquired. Program is written on Delphi and has high data processing and signal manipulations speed.

#### Features

- Works with Rohman PL500 eddy current device
- Set paramenters for 16 eddy current channels: drive, frequency, filtering, compensation etc.
- Automatic record start when probes enters inspected object. Automatic file saving when probes leaves inspected object. All of this is for no operatpr inspections
- Signal analysis and defects recognition
- Automatic defect parameters estimation
- Manual signal analysis
- Scripting module for data processing automation

### MagNum3D

Finite elements method modelling program
![](./img/magnum3d.png)

This finite elements method modelling program allows calculate electromagnetic fields distributions. It was created by me during studying in institute when I was a student. It allows to solve plane, axisymmetrical and 3d electromagnetic tasks. Finnite elements mesh is semi-regular, because it can be expanded and squeezed at several areas. Program was written in Delphi and it is very fast in solving tasks.

#### Features

- Tasks: electrostatic, steady state and eddy currents
- Mesh models for planes and in volume
- One model for 2D and 3D tasks calculations
- Post processing: vector field, force lines, surface of values, equipotential lines
- Plots for field values distribution along specified direction
- Calculations of potentials, flux dencity, intencity
- Calculations on magnetic curve for ferromagnetic materials
