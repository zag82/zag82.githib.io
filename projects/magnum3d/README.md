# MagNum3D - Finite elements method modelling program

This finite elements method modelling program allows calculate electromagnetic
fields distributions. It was created by me during studying in institute when I
was a student. It allows to solve plane, axisymmetrical and 3d electromagnetic
tasks. Finnite elements mesh is semi-regular, because it can be expanded and
squeezed at several areas. Program was written in Delphi and it is very fast in solving tasks.

## Features

- Tasks: electrostatic, steady state and eddy currents
- Mesh models for planes and in volume
- One model for 2D and 3D tasks calculations
- Post processing: vector field, force lines, surface of values, equipotential lines
- Plots for field values distribution along specified direction
- Calculations of potentials, flux dencity, intencity
- Calculations on magnetic curve for ferromagnetic materials
