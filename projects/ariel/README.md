# Ariel - Program for acquiring and processing eddy current signals from PL500 device

Program allows you to connect to Rohman PL500 eddy current testing device
and store eddy current testing data to files. Scecond application allows
to view and analyse signals acquired. Program is written on Delphi and
has high data processing and signal manipulations speed.

## Features

- Works with Rohman PL500 eddy current device
- Set paramenters for 16 eddy current channels: drive, frequency, filtering, compensation etc.
- Automatic record start when probes enters inspected object. Automatic file saving when probes leaveinspected object. All of this is for no operatpr inspections',
- Signal analysis and defects recognition
- Automatic defect parameters estimation
- Manual signal analysis
- Scripting module for data processing automation
